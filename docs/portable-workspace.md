# Run Frontline Forecast on another computer

## The easy way: open the live site

Use [production Frontline Forecast](https://nextjs-the-weather-desk.vercel.app/) on any phone, tablet, or computer. It is deployed on Vercel, so it remains available when this Mac is asleep, powered off, or its Terminal windows are closed.

## Develop from another computer

1. Install the current Node.js LTS release and Git.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abchambers/nextjs.git
   cd nextjs
   ```

3. Install packages once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values from the existing development computer or the provider dashboards. The Supabase service-role key and cron secret are server-only; keep them private. `.env.local` is intentionally private and is not included in Git.
5. Start development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the address printed by Next.js, usually `http://localhost:3000`.

When changes are ready, commit and push them to `main`; Vercel deploys the production site from that branch.

## Important distinction

- Closing a Terminal window stops only the local development server on that computer.
- The Vercel production site, Supabase authentication/archive, and scheduled verification jobs keep running independently.
- A local draft and browser preferences are stored per browser. Sign in to see the same cloud archive on another device; copy or recreate an unfinished local-only draft if you need it on a new machine.

## Optional: show a running local build on another device

Only while the development computer remains on and connected to the same network:

```bash
npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Open the network address printed by Next.js from the other device. Do not use this as a replacement for Vercel; closing the terminal or computer stops it.
