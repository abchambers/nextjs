# Project and URL transition

This records the controlled transition from the legacy technical project name to Frontline Forecast **before** a custom domain is purchased.

## Decision

- Customer app Vercel project: `frontline-forecast` ✓
- Current Vercel production URL: `https://frontline-forecast-the-weather-desk.vercel.app` ✓
- Company HQ future Vercel project: `frontline-forecast-hq`
- GitHub repository: `abchambers/frontline-forecast` ✓

The project and URL were verified through Vercel. Do not type another assumed address into authentication settings from memory.

## Manual order

1. The Vercel Project Name has been changed to `frontline-forecast` and its production deployment has been verified.
2. In **Settings → Environment Variables**, set the Production value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to `https://frontline-forecast-the-weather-desk.vercel.app`. Do not put a trailing path in it. Redeploy the latest successful commit after saving it.
3. In Supabase, open **Authentication → URL Configuration**. Set **Site URL** to `https://frontline-forecast-the-weather-desk.vercel.app`. Add these redirect URLs:
   - the new exact production URL followed by `/**`
   - `https://*-the-weather-desk.vercel.app/**` for Vercel previews
   - `http://localhost:3000/**` and `http://localhost:3001/**` for local work
   - keep `https://nextjs-the-weather-desk.vercel.app/**` only while it still resolves and until confirmation-email testing succeeds.
4. Send one confirmation or password-reset message to a test account. It must return to Frontline Forecast rather than `localhost` or an obsolete Vercel address.
5. The repository fallbacks, README, and operating docs are updated in this same change. Do not rename the Supabase project, database, or API identifiers in this step.

## Why this order

Vercel automatically gives projects a `.vercel.app` address based on the project name. Supabase uses its Site URL as the default for confirmation and reset messages, and it only honors explicit redirect targets in its allow-list. Configure both deliberately so registration never points at a local machine. See the [Vercel project naming guide](https://vercel.com/kb/guide/how-do-i-change-the-name-of-my-vercel-project) and [Supabase redirect URL guidance](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls).

## Intentionally not done here

- Buying or configuring a company domain.
- Renaming the Vercel team (`the-weather-desk`).
- Renaming the Supabase project, database, or API identifiers.
- Pointing a public link at HQ.

Those are separate changes with their own rollback and authentication checks.
