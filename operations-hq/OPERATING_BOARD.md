# Operating Board

Update this board when work changes state. It is the company-facing source of planning truth; the production application is not a project-management tool.

## Now — foundation work

| Outcome | Why it matters | Definition of done | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production confirmation return | New users finish registration on the real app, not localhost | Supabase Site URL/redirect allow-list configured; confirmation opens the production app; one end-to-end sign-up tested | Supabase dashboard configuration |
| Licensing data foundation | Schools can eventually be licensed without hand-managing every student | Migration applied; RLS reviewed; redemption transaction tested with a pilot organization | Apply licensing migration |
| Pilot journey audit | One instructor and one student can use the education loop without intervention | Register → join → assignment → submit → review is documented and tested | Confirmation return |

## Next — productization

| Outcome | Why it matters | Definition of done |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organization plan and invite views | School owners can understand seats and issue invitations | Simple entitlement summary, code creation, redemption, and expired-seat states |
| Auth hardening | Sessions and authorization become reliable across devices | Cookie-backed Supabase SSR auth; server-side claims validation; callback and reset paths covered |
| Operational visibility | Failures and provider costs are actionable | Error monitoring, source status, request/usage metering, cost alerts |
| Pilot materials | An educator can evaluate the product without a live walkthrough | One-page onboarding, classroom setup guide, support intake path |

## Research before committing

| Question | Decision needed before build |
| --- | --- |
| Billing provider and pricing | Subscription/contract model, trial length, taxes/invoicing, support burden |
| School privacy | Intended age range, pilot agreements, FERPA/COPPA posture, retention/export requirements |
| Data rights | Commercial use, attribution, caching, and redistribution rights for every source |
| Long-term domain model | Company domain, app subdomain, public weather domain, email domain |
| First paying customer | Instructor, department, school program, or professional forecast user |

## Intentionally deferred

- Running a proprietary numerical weather model.
- Selling or redistributing raw weather data as an API.
- Publicly publishing classroom/student forecasts.
- Enterprise SSO and roster-sync integrations.
- Full visual redesign of the live application.

Each is valuable, but none belongs ahead of secure onboarding, a successful pilot, and a known unit-cost model.
